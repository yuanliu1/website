I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Research Laboratory of Electronics and the Department of Physics at MIT, hosted by [Prof. Isaac Chuang](https://web.mit.edu/~cua/www/quanta/). I will join NCSU as an assistant professor starting January 2024 in the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://ece.ncsu.edu) and [Computer Science](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu). Email me if you are interested to join my group!

I am interested in studying quantum-classical algorithms to solve challenging problems in quantum chemistry, chemical physics, and material science, including correlated electronic structure and real-time dynamics. I also study protocols to leverage continuous-variable quantum systems such as bosonic oscillators for computation, information processing, and sensing. Another topic is the study of quantum error correction at a system or algorithm level. These topics are investigated from theoretical and computational perspectives, with possible experimental collaborations.

I received my Ph.D. in chemical physics and M.S. in electrical engineering from Brown University, supervised by [Prof. Brenda Rubenstein](https://rubenstein.group) and [Prof. Lai-Sheng Wang](https://sites.brown.edu/lswang/). I majored in physics as an undergrad at Tsinghua University. In my spare time I enjoy running and hiking.
